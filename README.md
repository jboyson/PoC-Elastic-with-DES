## üöÄ Description and Objective

The purpose of this proof of concept is to get a better understanding of how we can enrich and visualize data collected from networking devices running Dell Enterprise SONiC. Data collected during this is experiment is meant to be used for network engineers to optimize the flow of network traffic, reduce latency, balancing load across network paths, and ensuring the most efficient use of available resources.

## üìã Requirements

This experimental environment was hosted in a lab with a pair of Dell S5248ON-F switches and a single z9264-ON switch. The Elastic stack was installed using the instructions outlined in the Elastiflow documentation referenced here - https://docs.elastiflow.com/docs/data_platforms/elastic/install_ubuntu. The same envrionment can be created using Dell Enterprise SONiC GNS3 switch images.
