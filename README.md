## üöÄ Description and Objective

The purpose of this proof of concept is to get a better understanding of how we can enrich and visualize data collected from networking devices running Dell Enterprise SONiC. Data collected during this is experiment is meant to be used for network engineers to optimize the flow of network traffic, reduce latency, balancing load across network paths, and ensuring the most efficient use of available resources.

## üìã Requirements

Be sure to list requirements for building and utilizing the example PoC code here. This can include details such as languages / libraries / tools that must be used as well as what platforms the code has been validated to run on (Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.) Additional details may be added in the README under the src folder.


## üëè How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to the project. Please reference the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Dell-Networking/PoC-Index/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide in the PoC-Index repo for more details (this guide is common across Dell Networking PoC projects).
